# SONG (Database)

**Songs**: This is a CLI (Command Line Prompt) program without any Graphical User Interface. You’ll be provided an exe. application where you can run the program. The source code can also be opened separately and its user interface depends on the IDE/Text Editor being used. A window pops up for the program to be used, and in usual cases it’s a command prompt window. 

The first appearance of the program shows the **MAIN MENU**, where you’re given 3 options to choose from. The options are: 
* ` Add a new Song.` 
* ` Search any Song.`
* `Exit the Program.`

The user can type any of these three numbers to get respective response. As this is a generic program the user has to add the songs first. Those songs will be stored in a database if the database already exist, otherwise it will create one and then store it in an empty database.

With **1**. as the input the user will be asked to enter the following things: 
* ` Title of the Song.` 
* ` Artist(s).`
* ` Genre of the Song.`
* ` Name of the Album.`
* ` Release Date of the Song.`
* ` Length of the Song.`

With **2**. As the input the user will be asked to the Search the Song `**SEARCH MENU**` according to the categories provided by the typing the following numbers which are: 
* ` Artist of the Song.` 
* ` Genre of the Song.`
* `Album in which the song belongs.`
* ` Year of Release.`
* ` Go back to MAIN MENU.`
* ` EXIT the program.` 

The number `5` and `6` are not here for the search rather they’re the added functionality that can take us back to the **Main Menu** or **Exit** the program directly from here. 

With **3**. As the input the user can exit the program while storing all the data that was fed into the Database named `Song.txt`. If none was stored the program will exit with as it is as it was earlier.
